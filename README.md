 # PROJECT BACKGROUND
A movie-goer (me) is asking for a software application to make queries across multiple movie
databases simpler. There are many databases on the internet that contain data about movies
e.g., IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, Netflix etc. Typically, these sites contain ways to
purchase the movie and or review movie ratings. They may also contain some data about
rewards the movie has received such as Golden Globe or Academy Awards. These databases
are organized on the premise that you have a particular movie title, genre, or even actor in
mind and wish to find movies meeting these criteria. The Academy of Motion Pictures has a
database containing data regarding every Oscar award won for every category since the awards
inception. This database is query-able via their website.
For this project, the premise revolves strictly around Academy award winning movies and
linking Academy award queries with corresponding entries. The motivation for this project is
the client (me) wants to watch all movies that received best picture awards. I want the ability to
query a database, receive a list of these movies and links to information about each movie such
as reviews, rental/streaming options, actors. Furthermore, I want to be able to delete, add, and
update existing movies to best fit my needs.
